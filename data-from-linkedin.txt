Design and Modeling of 6 DOF Robot 


Duration: April 2025 - May 2025 


Association: Pakistan Institute of Engineering & Applied Sciences (PIEAS) 


Description: Details the design, modeling, and simulation of a six-degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) robotic arm specifically tailored for automated welding applications, addressing challenges of manual welding like inconsistency, safety hazards, and scalability limitations. The methodology integrates modular mechanical component design via Onshape/SolidWorks and URDF modeling for multi-platform compatibility. Comprehensive kinematic and workspace analyses were conducted using MATLAB, complemented by initial trajectory planning and control implementation within the CoppeliaSim environment. This study demonstrates the robot's capability for precise and repeatable welding operations, laying a foundational framework for cost-effective and autonomous fabrication systems enhancing both safety and efficiency.

News Classification using Gradient Boosting 


Duration: October 2024 - November 2024 


Description: Developed a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or true. The project involved preprocessing large text datasets, cleaning and tokenizing text, and transforming it into numerical features using a Bag-of-Words approach. A Gradient Boosting classifier was trained on the data for effective classification, implemented in Python (Google Colab) and MATLAB, with the model exported for future real-world applications.

VGA Graphics and Game Design on Spartan-3E FPGA 


Association: Pakistan Institute of Engineering & Applied Sciences (PIEAS) 


Project Highlight: Airplane Game on FPGA with VGA Output (Verilog). Hardware-level project implementing a minimalist airplane game using Verilog on a Spartan-3E FPGA board.


Main Objective: Generate a real-time VGA signal (640x480 resolution) and create an interactive visual experience entirely through register transfer level (RTL) design.


Key Features: VGA Signal Generation (Accurate Hsync and Vsync pulse generation for VGA timing compliance), Pixel-Based RGB Output (Pixel positions determine RGB values for rendering dynamic scenes), Interactive Triangular Plane (A triangle-shaped "plane" moves horizontally based on slide switch inputs), Animated Scenery (Real-time drawing of parabolic mountains and scrolling clouds using logic equations), Clock Division (50 MHz system clock divided down to 25 MHz for correct VGA pixel timing), Modular Verilog Design (Clean separation of modules: Sync Generator, Horizontal & Vertical Counters, Pixel Logic, Top-Level Integrator).


Tools & Technologies: Verilog HDL, Spartan-3E FPGA Board, Xilinx ISE Design Suite, ModelSim (for simulation and verification), VGA Monitor.


Project Outcome: Pure HDL project with no CPU, no external libraries, no software rendering. All visuals generated through timing-based logic using Verilog, demonstrating foundational digital design.
